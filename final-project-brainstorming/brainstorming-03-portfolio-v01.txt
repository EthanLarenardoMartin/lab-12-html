Portfolio
    Thankfully I have a lot I can show off from my first semester and High School regarding work I did in the fields I mentioned in About Me. This ranges from an experimental video I made, a short game I developed in Unity, ideas for a project I made with an Arduino, and pictures from shows I worked on. I have most of this documented already, so the main thing I would have to focus on for this step is inserting it neatly and briefly explain my role for each project, including the year each one took place in.
