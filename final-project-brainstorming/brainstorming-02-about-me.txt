About Me

    Hi! My name is Ethan Larenardo Martin. I am a recent graduate from Edward R. Murrow High School, and currently enrolled in my first year at New York City College of Technology, or City Tech for short. My current major is Emerging Media Technology and looking forward to choosing Game Design and Interactive Media or Physical Computing as my future concentrations.

    While I am still a beginner at languages like HTML,Python, and JavaScript, I take pride in what I learned so far these past two semesters and more in the years to come. I also have about 2 years of experience in Stage Production, specifically Lighting, from doing it in High School. Because of my growing experience in both these fields, in 5 years I find myself doing either software development or working for a theater company. There isn't a specific company in mind for either of these, but I wouldn't mind working for anyone who has a passion in what they are trying to produce.
